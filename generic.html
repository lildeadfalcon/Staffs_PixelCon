								<h3>About them</h3>
								<p>By using technology ranging from modified joypads to eye-control, they're finding ways for people to play to the very best of their abilities. They're not just doing it for fun. By levelling the playing field, they are bringing families and friends together and having a profoundly positive impact on confidence and rehabilitation. Everyone's abilities are different. So SpecialEffect visit people, find out what they want to play, and exactly what they need to play it. They then match, modify or create equipment to lend to them, and give support so the people they help can get the best out of it.</p>

								<p>As a community, gamers have always had each others backs one way or another. granted there can be some salt every now and then but majoritly we are a unified group. This charity is helping more people, less fortunate than us, become apart of our cluster. Which is why we wanted to support them using this event. To raise as much money for the kind hearted in order to bring more gamers into the world.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>How you can help</h4>
								<p>All proceeds from the event will be going to this charity. Including the entry fee, and our dark horse, stream donations. Our beginning aim is a measly £100 which can easily be reached. We then have other milestones we would like to reach such as £500 and £1000 with events, such as heads being shaved, if these milestones are reached.</p>

								<p>We can only do so much on our end by putting on this event and donating ourselves. This is why we need the community with us. Together we can pull together peoples resources and donate for a good cause. The way you can help us is by donating, obviously, and spreading the word. Share our event, get it out there and hype it up with us. And together we will put on a show for the world to see. </p>
